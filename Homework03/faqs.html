        <p id="q1" class="articleTitle">What is Creative Commons and what can you do?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and
            knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage
            reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms; those who want to make
            creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others
            realize the full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates all over the world who help ensure our
            licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work.
        </p>
        <p class="articleText">
            Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work extends beyond just providing copyright
            licenses. CC offers other legal and technical tools that also facilitate sharing and discovery of creative
            works, such as CC0, a public domain dedication for rights holders who wish to put their work into the
            public domain before the expiration of copyright, and the Public Domain Mark, a tool for marking a work
            that is in the worldwide public domain. Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed specifically to
            work with the web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy to search for, discover, and use.
        </p>
        <p class="articleText">
            For more information about CC, our main website contains in-depth information about the organization, its
            staff and board of directors, its history, and its supporters. You can also read CC case studies to learn
            about some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used to share works and support innovative
            business models. You can find regularly updated information about CC by visiting the blog.

        <p id="q2" class="articleTitle">Is Creative Commons against copyright?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            Absolutely not. CC has responded to claims to the contrary. CC licenses are copyright licenses, and depend
            on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators and other rights holders
            can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights. Those who want to make
            their work available to the public for limited kinds of uses while preserving their copyright may want to
            consider using CC licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their rights under copyright law should not
            use CC licenses.
        </p>
        <p class="articleText">
            That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright law, and many members of the
            Creative Commons community are active participants in the copyright reform movement. For more information,
            see our statement in support of copyright reform.

        <p id="q3" class="articleTitle">What does "Some Rights Reserved" mean?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            Copyright grants to creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their creative works, which generally
            include, at a minimum, the right to reproduce, distribute, display, and make adaptations. The phrase
            "All Rights Reserved" is often used by owners to indicate that they reserve all of the rights granted to
            them under the law. When copyright expires, the work enters the public domain, and the rights holder can
            no longer stop others from engaging in those activities under copyright, with the exception of moral rights
            reserved to creators in some jurisdictions. Creative Commons licenses offer creators a spectrum of choices
            between retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights (public domain), an approach we call "Some Rights
            Reserved."

        <p id="q4" class="articleTitle">Can Creative Commons give legal advice about its licenses or other tools,
            or help with CC license enforcement?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice or legal services. CC is similar
            to a self-help service that offers free, form-based legal documents for others to use. These FAQ answers
            many of the most common questions.

        <p id="q5" class="articleTitle">Does Creative Commons collect or track material licensed under a CC license?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            No, CC does not collect content or track licensed material. However, CC builds technical tools that help
            the public search for and use works licensed under our licenses and other legal tools, and many others have
            built such tools as well. CC Search is one tool developed by CC to help the public discover works offered
            under Creative Commons licenses on the internet via CC-aware search engines and repositories.

        <p id="q6" class="articleTitle">What do the Creative Commons buttons do?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            The CC buttons are a shorthand way to convey the basic permissions associated with material offered under
            CC licenses. Creators and owners who apply CC licenses to their material can download and apply those
            buttons to communicate to users the permissions granted in advance. When the material is offered online,
            the buttons should usually link out to the human-readable license deeds (which, in turn, link to the
            license itself).
        </p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <p id="q7" class="articleTitle">May I use the Creative Commons logo and buttons?</p>
        <p class="articleText">
            You may download high resolution versions of the Creative Commons logos and use them in connection with
            your work or your website, provided you comply with our policies. Among other things, if you use the logos
            on a website or on your work, you may not alter the logos in any respect—such as by changing the font, the
            proportions, or the colors. CC's buttons, name, and corporate logo (the “CC” in a circle) are trademarks of
            Creative Commons. You cannot use them in ways not permitted by our policies unless you first receive
            express, written permission. This means, for example, that you cannot (without our permission) print your
            own buttons and t-shirts using CC logos, although you can purchase them in CC’s store.

        <p id="q8" class="articleTitle">I love Creative Commons. How can I help?</p>
        <p class="articleText">

            or by credit card. You can also support CC by visiting our store.

        <p class="articleText">
            CC always welcomes your feedback, which you can provide by emailing info@creativecommons.org. You can
            also participate in CC's email discussion lists and share feedback and ideas in one of those forums.
        </p>
        <p class="articleText">
            If you are a software developer, sysadmin, or have other technical expertise, please join our developer
            community and help build the tools that build the commons.
